I was walking home from school when I saw him. He was standing on the corner, smoking a cigarette. I tried to walk past him, but he called out to me. He asked me my name, and I told him. He asked me where I was going, and I told him I was going home. He asked if he could walk with me, and I said no. But he kept following me. He started making lewd comments about my body, and telling me what he wanted to do to me. I tried to ignore him, but he kept following me. I was getting scared. I started to walk faster, but he was right behind me. I was about to start running when he grabbed me. I screamed, and he covered my mouth. I was terrified. I thought he was going to rape me. But then he let me go and ran away. I was shaking and crying. I couldn't believe what had just happened. I didn't know what to do. I was so scared.

I love animals, so when I saw the little black cat hanging around my house, I started putting out food for him. Everyday, I would put a bowl of food and water out for him. He started coming around more and more, and soon, he was coming to my house every day. I started to call him Blackie. He was so sweet, and I loved him. One day, when I went to put his food out, he wasn't there. I looked for him all around the neighborhood, but I couldn't find him. I was so worried. I thought something had happened to him. But then, a few days later, he showed up again. I was so relieved. I couldn't imagine what I would do if something happened to him. I'm so glad he's safe.

I'm the one my friends come to for advice. I'm good at giving advice, because I've been through a lot in my life. I've had to deal with strict parents, mean girls at school, and all the ups and downs of teenage life. So, when my friends have problems, they know they can come to me. I'm always happy to help. I've been through a lot, and I know what it's like to feel alone and lost. So, if I can help my friends, I will. I know I can't fix all their problems, but I can at least help them feel better. And that's what matters.

I'm the new girl at school. I just moved here, and I don't know anyone. It's been really hard. I thought it would be easy to make friends, but it's not. Everyone here seems to already have their friend groups, and I don't know how to break into them. I've been sitting by myself at lunch, and no one has talked to me in class. I feel so alone. I miss my old friends and my old school. I just want to go home. But I know I have to make the best of it. I'm just hoping that someday, I'll find my place here.

When I was younger, I always felt like I had to be strong. I couldn't show any weakness, because I was afraid of what people would think. I was afraid they would think I was weak, and I didn't want that. So, I kept everything inside. I didn't tell anyone how I was feeling, because I didn't want them to know. I was always the strong one, the one who had to be there for everyone else. But it was hard. I was always putting on a brave face, even when I was falling apart inside.

I've always had to be strong. It's never been an option for me to be weak. I've always had to be the one to hold everything together. I've had to be the one to be there for everyone else, even when I wasn't feeling okay myself. It's a lot of pressure, and it's hard. But I've never had a choice. I've always had to be strong.

I've always had to be the strong one. In my family, we didn't talk about our feelings. We were expected to bottle everything up and to be strong. It was hard, because I always felt like I was holding everything in. I was always afraid to show any weakness, because I didn't want people to think I was weak. I was always the one who had to be there for everyone else, even when I wasn't feeling okay myself. It was a lot of pressure, and it was hard. But I never had a choice. I've always had to be strong.

When I was younger, I was always the one my friends came to for advice. I was good at giving advice, because I cared about people. I wanted to help them, and I could see the good in them, even when they couldn't see it themselves. I knew that I wanted to help people, and I knew that I wanted to be a therapist. So, I worked hard in school, and I got into a good college. And now, I'm a therapist. I help people every day, and I love it.

I've always been a caring person. I've always wanted to help people. I can't stand to see people struggling, and I want to help them. I knew that I wanted to be a therapist, so I could help people every day. I worked hard in school, and I got into a good college. And now, I'm a therapist. I help people every day, and I love it.

I was always the shy girl in school. I was never really good at standing up for myself. So, when I got to high school and I was bullied, I didn't know what to do. I was scared to stand up to my bully, because I didn't want to make things worse. But, one day, I realized that I had to stand up for myself. I couldn't keep letting her bully me. I had to be brave. So, I faced my bully. I told her to stop, and I told her that I wasn't going to take it anymore. And she did. She stopped bullying me. And, from then on, I was brave. I was the one who stood up for myself, and I was the one who wasn't going to take anything from anyone.

I've always been a pretty happy person. But lately, I've been having a lot of depressing thoughts. I can't seem to shake them. They're always there, haunting me. I try to push them away, but they always come back. I try to focus on the good things in my life, but it's hard. All I can think about is how much I'm struggling. I feel like I'm failing. I feel like I'm not good enough. I feel like I'm not worth anything. I know these thoughts aren't true, but they feel so real. And they're so hard to shake.

I've always been aware of the unfairness in society. I see it everyday. I see how people are treated differently because of their race, their gender, their sexuality. It's not right. I see how people are judged and discriminated against, and it makes me so mad. I can't stand it. I want to do something to change it, but I don't know what. I feel like I'm powerless. But I'm not going to give up. I'm going to keep fighting, until things change.

I was once a victim of the unfairness in society. I was judged and discriminated against because of my race. I was called names and made to feel like I was less than everyone else. It was hard. I felt so alone and so lost. But I didn't give up. I kept fighting. And, eventually, things started to change. I started to see more people like me in positions of power. I started to see the world changing. And I knew that I had made a difference.

I want to change the unfairness in society. I want to make a difference. I know I can't do it alone, but I'm going to keep fighting. I'm going to keep speaking out. I'm going to keep fighting for what's right. Because I know that, eventually, things will change. And, when they do, I want to be a part of it.

I was the first one in my family to go to college. It was a big deal. My parents were so proud of me. They had always wanted me to go to college, but they never thought it would be possible. But I worked hard, and I got into a good school. And, now, I'm the first one in my family to go to college. It's been hard. I'm not used to being away from my family. And I miss them. But I know this is what I have to do. I have to make them proud. And I will.

I was at a party, and I was talking to this guy. I thought he was really cute, so I was flirting with him. But then, he started to get really handsy. He wouldn't keep his hands to himself. He kept touching me, even when I said no. I tried to push him away, but he wouldn't stop. I was getting really scared. But then, my friend showed up and rescued me. I was so grateful.

I was really excited to go to college. I had worked so hard to get into a good school. But, once I got there, I realized that it wasn't what I thought it would be. I was struggling. I was barely scraping by. I was working so hard, and I was still failing. I didn't understand why. I thought college was supposed to be the best time of my life. But, for me, it was just a lot of stress and anxiety. I was constantly worried about my grades, and I was always afraid I was going to fail. It was hard. But I didn't give up. I kept fighting. And, eventually, I made it through.

I want to be a therapist because I want to help people. I've been through a lot in my life, and I know what it's like to feel alone and lost. I want to be there for people. I want to help them through their struggles. I want to be a light in their dark times. I want to show them that they're not alone. That's why I want to be a therapist.

I was young when I saw my father treat my mother unfairly. I didn't understand it then, but I do now. I remember how he would yell at her and call her names. I remember how he would hit her. I was so scared. I didn't know what to do. I would try to help her, but I was just a child. I didn't know how to make it stop. I felt so helpless. I hated seeing my mother treated that way.

Even if it's just a small difference, it's worth it to me.

I never used to be a very strong person. I was always scared of conflict. I was always scared of getting hurt. But then, I realized that I needed to learn how to defend myself. I needed to be able to protect myself. So, I started taking martial arts classes. And I got really good at it. I started to feel more confident. I started to feel stronger. And I knew that I could defend myself if I ever needed to.

My family is my life. I would do anything for them. So, when they started to get older, I started to worry about their health and well-being.

I adopted a dog from my local animal shelter last year and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Not only did I save a life, but I also gained a loyal and loving friend.
I fell in love with a sweet little lab mix named Mia. She was so scared and timid at the shelter, but I could tell that she had a lot of love to give. I took her home that day and she's been by my side ever since.

It's been almost a year now, and Mia has completely transformed. She's no longer scared and timid, but is instead a confident and happy dog. She loves going on walks, playing fetch, and snuggling up on the couch with me. I'm so glad that I adopted her and gave her a second chance at a happy life.

I remember feeling so alone and lost when I was going through my tough times, and I don't want any kid to feel like that.

It means the world to me to know that I'm making a difference and helping these kids understand something that can be so confusing and scary.

I was walking to my car after a long day of work when I was suddenly approached by a man. He was walking close to me and making me feel uncomfortable, so I quickened my pace. But he kept pace with me and then started to make lewd comments. I was so upset and scared that I started to cry. I was about to call for help when the man suddenly ran off. I was shaken up but relieved that nothing worse had happened.
It's so upsetting to think about how often this happens to women. We should be able to walk down the street without having to worry about being harassed. It's not fair that we have to live in fear like this, but sadly it's a reality for many of us. I hope that by sharing my story, other women will feel empowered to speak up and stand up for themselves if they ever find themselves in a similar situation.

The boy sits in the chair across from me, looking down at his hands. He's been quiet for most of the session, and I can tell he's struggling. I ask him how he's been doing and he finally looks up at me. His eyes are full of sadness and pain.

I'm moving into my own apartment for the first time and I'm so excited. I have my own space that I can decorate however I want and I don't have to share with anyone.
