When I was a little girl, my parents would often take me to see a therapist. It felt like a kind of ritual; they would tell me that I needed help, and I would go see her. I would sit in her office, and she would ask me questions about my life. Sometimes she would tell me that I needed to talk to someone about my problems, and other times she would just listen. I always felt like she was there for me, and I really appreciated her help.

I decided to learn how to ride a bike on a warm day. I had seen other people doing it and it looked like fun. My friend showed me how to get on the bike and pedal. At first, I was a little scared but I soon got the hang of it. I rode the bike around the block a few times and then went home. I was so proud of myself for learning how to ride a bike.

I was at the dentist for a filling and he told me I needed to have the tooth extracted. I was really shocked because he didn't tell me that I might need additional treatment. I ended up suing him.

I had grown up playing softball, and it was always my favorite sport. I loved the feeling of hitting the ball and watching it fly over the fence. I was a natural leader on the field, and my teammates always looked to me for guidance. I always dreamed of leading my team to a championship one day.

I loved the feeling of the wind rushing through my hair as I ran. I was always one of the quickest runners on the track, and my endurance was unmatched. Though I never pursued track as a career, I always enjoyed the freedom of running.

I grew up in a family with limited resources. I attended a local school where I struggled to keep up with my classmates. Despite the challenges, I persevered and was able to graduate from high school. I then went on to college, where I was able to take advantage of opportunities and resources that I otherwise would not have had access to.
