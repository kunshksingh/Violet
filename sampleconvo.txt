T: Hi! How may I help you?
P:  I'm feeling down lately.

T: That sounds tough. I'm here to listen if you want to talk about it.
P:  I don't really know, how would a therapist help me?

T: Well, sometimes it can be helpful to talk to someone who will understand and can offer helpful advice. Is there anything in particular you would like to talk about?
P: I don't know where to start.

T:  That's okay. Why don't we start with telling me a little bit about yourself?
P: I'm... a college school student I guess. I'm in my second year.

T: What's been going on that's been tough for you lately?
P: I feel like I'll never be enough. I don't know this feels kind of useless.
