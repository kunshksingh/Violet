Experiences Dump:
1.When I was a little girl, my parents would often take me to see a therapist. It felt like a kind of ritual; they would tell me that I needed help, and I would go see her. I would sit in her office, and she would ask me questions about my life. Sometimes she would tell me that I needed to talk to someone about my problems, and other times she would just listen. I always felt like she was there for me, and I really appreciated her help.
